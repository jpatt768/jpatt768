Hi there,

My name is Jayden Patterson. I am living and working in Tokyo and learning iOS development with Swift. I recently completed a 2-part course with RMIT University Online and I’m in the process of putting my first app on the App Store.

In my previous company in 2018 I took an interest in HTML and CSS and started learning online but soon changed jobs and took a position as a recruiter with Rakuten Mobile which involved a lot of overseas travel and overtime. As much as I loved this position It meant that I had no time to continue my study. 

Once Covid hit I was transferred internally to a completely different position but this meant that I had more time up my sleeve to get back into coding and I wanted to create something that felt a little more tangible than a website so decided to look into courses would help me learn Swift.

I currently live in Tokyo and I am a fluent Japanese speaker but plan to move to Melbourne in early 2022 and can start in a new position with a month’s notice.

Thank you for taking the time to look through my projects and if you have any questions you can contact me at jpatt768@gmail.com.
